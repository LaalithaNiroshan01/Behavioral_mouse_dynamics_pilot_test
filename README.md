## 📌 Overview
This repository contains a standalone, client-side web application designed to conduct human-computer interaction (HCI) pilot tests. The tool captures high-frequency mouse telemetry data—specifically coordinate tracking (X, Y), velocity, and click patterns—while users perform designated cognitive tasks. 

## 🎓 Research Context
[cite_start]This tool was developed as **Work Package 2: Technical Pilot & Feasibility Phase** [cite: 359] [cite_start]for the undergraduate software engineering research project: *"Emotion-Adaptive Focus Mode Browser Extension"*[cite: 2]. 

[cite_start]The primary goal of this pilot is to gather empirical behavioral data to mathematically determine the thresholds for "Jitter" and "Velocity" in relation to cognitive load[cite: 363]. [cite_start]It also serves to calibrate "Rage Click" detection logic to prevent false positives in the final machine-learning fusion engine[cite: 364].

## ✨ Key Features
* **Zero-Setup Execution:** Runs entirely in the browser using standard HTML/CSS/JS. No local server or backend required.
* **Controlled Task Environments:**
    * [cite_start]**Task A (Low Stress):** A baseline reading comprehension task without time constraints[cite: 423].
    * [cite_start]**Task B (High Stress):** A timed logic and mathematics section designed to induce mild cognitive load and urgency[cite: 424].
* **High-Frequency Telemetry:** Captures mouse movements throttled to ~60Hz to calculate real-time movement velocity.
* **Automated CSV Export:** Compiles captured data into a structured CSV file for immediate statistical analysis.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Clone or Download** this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `pilot_test.html` directly in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
3. **Setup:** Enter a Participant ID (or leave blank for an anonymous ID) and click **Start Recording**.
4. **Execution:** * Have the participant complete Task A at their natural pace.
    * Have the participant complete Task B within the 30-second implied limit.
5. **Export:** Click the **Download Raw Data (CSV)** button at the bottom of the page to save the session logs.

## 🗄️ Data Output Format
The exported CSV file contains the following structured data:

| Column | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Timestamp` | Standard UNIX epoch timestamp (ms). |
| `Participant` | Unique identifier for the test subject. |
| `EventType` | Type of interaction (e.g., `MOVE`, `GLOBAL_CLICK`, `SELECTED: [Option]`, `MARKER`). |
| `X` | Mouse X-coordinate on the viewport. |
| `Y` | Mouse Y-coordinate on the viewport. |
| `Velocity` | Calculated speed between the current and previous coordinate (px/ms). |

## 🛠️ UI/UX Design
The interface utilizes a modern, calm, light-themed aesthetic to ensure the UI itself does not induce baseline stress prior to the tasks. It features soft shadows, intuitive active states, and clear typography to maintain a highly controlled testing environment.
